# Welcom to ToonTanks

This is one of my first games I've worked on implementing. The player will take control of a tank and battle their way through various stages, almost like a reverse tower defense. They will have to dodge turrets and work their way through each level, destroying anything in their path.

# The Process and Tools

I am using Unreal Engine to build this using publicly available models. Everything is done by writing code in C++ and minimal blueprint capabilities. Mainly, I am doing this as a way of learning the platform and the C++ coding language. Unfortunately, it is taking kind of a backseat to my schoolwork and some other projects right now. Eventually, I will return to it and continue fleshing it out.

# Goals of the Project

- Allow user to take control of an actor, drive around the map and shoot
- Implement simple turret enemies that track the player and fire at a fixed rate.
- Create proper hitbox modelling to handle impacts of various objects (players and walls, missiles and turrets, etc.)
